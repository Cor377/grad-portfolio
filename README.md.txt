# Grad Portfolio

I’m an undergrad at the University of Melbourne aiming for top US graduate programs in **Computer Science / Applied Mathematics / Statistics**. 
This repo will collect **reproducible projects**, **research notes**, and **weekly logs** while I strengthen core fundamentals (data structures & algorithms, linear algebra, probability, statistics).

**Goal (this year):** finish two flagship projects (one engineering/system, one data/math), contribute to a research group, and document everything clearly so others can reproduce my results.

- `projects/` — code & demos
- `papers/` — notes, drafts, posters
- `logs/` — weekly progress logs
