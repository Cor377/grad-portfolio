# Algorithm Visuals and Benchmarks
**Goal:** Comparing runtime and correctness of [bubble / insertion / merge / quick] sort on [random integer arrays]. Producing a reproduciable script and a bar chart.

**Milestones**
-v0:runnable scripts; all four scipts passed correctness test; make one bar chart 
-v1:average multiple sizes and repetitions; show result and conclusions
-v2:Streamlit page to choose input size and plot interactively

**How to run**
